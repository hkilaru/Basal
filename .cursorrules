-This is the base of an modern, open-source SwiftUI app that uses HealthKit.
-The primary goal is to demonstrate Apple's latest best practices in using HealthKit in a SwiftUI app.
-Never use third-party libraries.
-When fixing bugs, don't use one-off conditionals that contradict a function's name or purpose.
-Avoid custom setup unless absolutely necessary. Always use Apple's recommended methods.
-For complex functions, add comments and unit tests.
-Others will be using this code as a starting point to build their own apps using HealthKit so keep the code clean and easy to understand.
-Keep code maintainable and separate files by functionality. If a file is doing too many things, break it up.
